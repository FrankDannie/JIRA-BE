## How to get started

# Installation of Python 3.10 

- Please download the installer for your OS from the official Python site.
 [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

## Installation of Poetry

- Install Poetry by executing the following command in the terminal or command prompt.

```bash
pip install poetry
```

## Setting up the Poetry Environment

- Use Poetry to build the Python environment. Please execute the following commands in order.

```bash
poetry shell
poetry install
```

## Configuration of the Pre-commit Hook

- Set up a pre-commit hook to automatically check the code before committing.

```bash
poetry run poe install_pre_commit
```

- This command will automatically perform the necessary checks at commit time.

## Starting the Development Environment

- Use the following command to launch the development server, etc.

```bash
poetry run poe dev
```

_This project uses [poe the poet](https://poethepoet.natn.io) for running scripts as task runners. It also works with .env files._ 

## Environment variables

_Because we are still using the free version of GitHub, application public environment variable should be set in the repository `Actions` environment variables. Please suffix your environment variables with the following suffix:_ /


- `_DEV`: For environment variables that should only be set for `Development` environment.
- `_GLOBAL`: For environment variables that should be set for all environment.


Example: `DB_HOST_DEV`, `LOG_LEVEL_PRD`, `APP_SERVER_PORT_GLOBAL`.




As for secret variables, the application should be retrieved directly from a secret store manager. In our case, most of our secrets are in Azure Key Vault, so we are using [Azure's SDK](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/key-vault/secrets/quick-create-python?tabs=azure-cli).



ðŸŽ‰ Happy coding! ðŸŽ‰

# branch strategy
/ Multiple types of branches (feature, develop, release, hotfix, main) are utilized.
/ The "develop" branch acts as the main axis of development, with new features being developed in "feature" branches and then merged into "develop".
/ When ready for release, a "release" branch is created from "develop", where final testing and bug fixes are performed before being merged into "main" and tagged.
/ In cases where urgent bug fixes are needed, a "hotfix" branch is created from "main", and after the fixes, it is merged back into both "main" and "develop".
